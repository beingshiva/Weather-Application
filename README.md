## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, Weatherbit API)

## Key Features

- **Location Search**: Users can search for a location by city name, ZIP code, or coordinates to retrieve weather information for that specific location.
- **Current Weather Data**: The application displays the current weather conditions for the searched location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- **Forecast**: Users can view the weather forecast for the upcoming days, including temperature trends and weather conditions.
- **Unit Conversion**: The application may provide options to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature, metric and imperial for wind speed).
- **Geolocation**: The app may include a feature to detect the user's current location automatically and display the weather information accordingly.
